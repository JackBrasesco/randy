Goal: Be the player with the closest guess of the sum of your 5 dice rolls.

Rules: Each player makes a whole number guess from 5 to 30 and enters it into their guess box. Players are awarded more points for guessing and winning with less probably sums. Then, Player 1 presses the roll button 5 times. Player 2 presses the roll button 5 times. The player whose sum is closest to their original guess wins. If both players are the same distance away from their guess, the game restarts but players keep their guesses for that round.
